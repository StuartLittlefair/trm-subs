'trm.subs' is a Python module that provides a few generally useful utilities 
that are sometimes required by other modules.

Installation:

As well as standard Python, you will need 'numpy', 'scipy' and my C++ subs 
package. Once these are installed, install with the usual

python setup.py install --prefix=your_top_level_installation_directory
